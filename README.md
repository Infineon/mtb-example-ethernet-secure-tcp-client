# Ethernet: Secure TCP Client

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a secure TCP client with XMC7000. 

In this example, a TCP client establishes a secure connection with a TCP server through an SSL handshake. After the SSL handshake completes successfully, the TCP client turns ON or OFF the user LED based on the command received from the TCP server. 

This example uses the Ethernet Core FreeRTOS lwIP mbedtls library of the SDK. This library enables application development based on Ethernet by bundling together various other libraries - FreeRTOS, lwIP TCP/IP stack, mbed TLS, and secure sockets. The secure sockets library provides an easy-to-use API by abstracting the network stack (lwIP) and the security stack (mbed TLS).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Ethernet: Secure TCP Client](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ethernet-secure-tcp-client)" application with the desired name "MySecureTCPClient" configured for the *KIT_XMC72_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id mtb-example-ethernet-secure-tcp-client --user-app-name MySecureTCPClient --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Connect one LAN cable from the target board(client) to the router and another LAN cable from your PC(server) to the router.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Open a command shell from the project directory and run the Python TCP secure server (*{project directory}\python-secure-tcp-server*) by typing in the following command:

     ```
     python tcp_secure_server.py
     ```

     On Linux and MacOS, check for the IPv4 address of ethernet connection in the network settings under System settings. For example, if the IPv4 address of the Linux or MacOS is found to be 192.168.1.2, then replace the following line of code in the _tcp_secure_server.py_ python script with the IPv4 address as shown before running the script.

   Replace 
   ```
   host = ''       # Symbolic name meaning the local host 
   ```
   with
   ```
   host = '192.168.1.2'       # Symbolic name meaning the local host 
   ``` 

     **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your computer allow access to the Python software so as to allow communication with the TCP client. See this [community thread](https://community.infineon.com/t5/ModusToolbox-General/CE229112-Enable-Python-access-to-your-WiFi/td-p/214654).

5. Change the `TCP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` and `TCP_SERVER_PORT` macros defined in the *secure_tcp_client.h* file to match with the computer's(server) IP address and port number. For example, if your computer's IP address is
   192.168.1.2 and port number is 50007, update the macros as shown below:

   ```
   #define TCP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS    MAKE_IPV4_ADDRESS(192, 168, 1, 2)
   #define TCP_SERVER_PORT          (50007u)
   ```

6. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=KIT_XMC72_EVK TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

7. Determine the PC's(server) IP address.

   To determine the IP address, enter the following command in the command shell based on your operating system:

   Windows: `ipconfig`

   Linux: `curl ifconfig.me`

   macOS: `ifconfig |grep inet`


8. In the terminal program, enter the server IP address determined in Step 7.

**Note:** 
- The code example has been tested in a local LAN setup and in a simple private network such as a home network with VPN disabled. To test it in a complex network such as an enterprise network, please contact your IT department.
- Check whether the port used for communication on your PC is an active port or not. If not, then you will have to open the firewall port. To display all the blocked and active ports configured in the firewall on PC, open command prompt(cmd for Windows) and enter the following command. 
```
netsh firewall show state
```


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

This example executes an RTOS task: TCP client task. 
In this example, the TCP client establishes a secure connection with a TCP server through SSL handshake. During the SSL handshake, the client presents its SSL certificate (self-signed) for verification and also verifies the server's identity to which it is connecting. Once the SSL handshake completes successfully, the TCP client controls the user LED ON or OFF based on the command received from the TCP server. See [Creating a self-signed certificate](#Creating-a-self-signed-SSL-certificate) for more details.

<br />

### Creating a self-signed SSL certificate

The TCP client demonstrated in this example uses a self-signed SSL certificate. This requires **OpenSSL** which is already preloaded in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation. Self-signed SSL certificate means that there is no third-party certificate issuing authority, commonly referred to as CA, involved in the authentication of the client. Servers connecting to this client must have an exact copy of the SSL certificate to verify the client's identity.

Follow the steps below to generate a self-signed SSL certificate:

#### Generate SSL certificate and private key

1. Run the following commands with a CLI (on Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application) to generate the SSL certificate and private key.

   ```
   openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout client.key -out client.crt
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the command window to provide the details required for creating SSL certificate and private key.

The *client.crt* file is your client's certificate and *client.key* is your client's private key.
